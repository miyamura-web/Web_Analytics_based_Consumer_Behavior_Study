# Analyzing Consumer Behavior through Web Analytics

## 📊 Project Overview :
In the era of digital commerce, understanding consumer behavior is critical for optimizing user experience and driving sales. This project focuses on analyzing consumer interactions with the Myntra e-commerce platform using Web Analytics Data combined with Sentiment Analysis on product-related consumer feedback.

## 📚 Method :
The project involves two main components:

• **Web Analytics Analysis** – Using data such as page views, session duration, traffic sources, bounce rates, and conversions to understand how different user segments (based on age groups and traffic sources) engage with the website.

• **Sentiment Analysis** – Applying natural language processing techniques on customer reviews to assess the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) associated with different products, identifying consumer perceptions and their potential influence on purchasing behavior.

An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes key insights, making it easy to track consumer engagement patterns, identify bottlenecks in the user journey, and highlight sentiment trends. The project helps businesses like Myntra make data-driven decisions to enhance user engagement, improve product offerings, and ultimately increase conversion rates.


### ⚙️Tools Used :
- **Power BI** – For interactive dashboard visualization.
- **Python (Optional)** – For Sentiment Analysis and also for data pre-processing and cleaning before importing into Power BI.
